#Typescript + Express + Mongo + InversifyJS + Redis + React = Awesome

This project is a fully working bootstrap for developping an express/mongo api with typescript, and React on front.

## Why is it awesome ?

 - Typescript.
 - SOLID code
 - Dependency container (Inversify)
 - CSRF
 - API using token auth
 - Easy to configure
 - React and Webpack on the front side
 - Separate backend and front end code, so you can use only one part of it, or both if you need
 - gulp watch and browser live reload
 - gulp watch for unit tests
 - You have professional starter kit for your web/mobile startup: you can develop REST API, and consume it in any client: React, ReactNative, Angular and so many others...
  
## Installation

 - clone the repo
 - profit

## TODO/ coming soon
 - React working integration
 - Authentication with token
 - CSRF handled by front services
 - few other things to make this little project great for U :)
 
## Have an idea which can be used here ?
 Give your shot and write to me. I'm opened to new ideas and solution. Especially
 to that one which can help us - developers - shortern our time while bootstraping a
 project.

 If you would like to use it in your project, using also hands of the author, let me know ;).
