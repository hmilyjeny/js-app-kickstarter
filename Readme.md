#Starter for Typescript + Express + Mongo + InversifyJS + separated frontend on React application. 

This project is a fully working bootstrap for developping an express/mongo api with typescript, and React on front.

## Why is it awesome ?

 - Typescript.
 - SOLID code
 - Dependency container (Inversify)
 - API using token auth
 - Easy to configure
 - React and Webpack on the front side
 - Separate backend and front end code, so you can use only one part of it, or both if you need
 - gulp watch and browser live reload
 - gulp watch for unit tests
   
## Installation

 - clone the repo
 - `npm i`
 - `gulp`
 - code

## TODO/ coming soon
 - unit test
 - documentation
 - inversify config instead of `provideX` annotation ?
 - modules system with extendable inversify config?
 
## Have an idea which can be used here ?
 Please contact me if you have an suggestion what can be used here, or what is wrong.
